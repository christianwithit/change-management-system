Design Goal: Mirror the authority of a formal Vision Group Internal Memo  using the modern Tailwind CSS v4 aesthetic of the CMS.

1. Visual Standards
Color Palette: Vision Red (#CF2E2E) for approvals; Vision Black (#0F172A) for structural elements.

The "Digital Document" View: Use a container with a subtle shadow and white background to mimic a physical A4 page on desktop.

Icons (Phosphor Icons): * ph-identification-card for User Access Matrix.

ph-shield-check for Security sections.

ph-pencil-line for the Signature area.

2. Interaction Model (The Sign-off Card)
Wizard-Style Steps: Users only see the checklist relevant to their role to reduce clutter.

Click-to-Sign UI: A prominent "Digitally Sign & Approve" button. Upon clicking, it replaces the button with a Certified Stamp showing the user’s name, role, and a "Verified" badge.

Status Indicators: Use the Timeline Status Guide:

Green: Signed & Approved.

Yellow: Pending this user's review.

Red: Rejected/Revision needed.
